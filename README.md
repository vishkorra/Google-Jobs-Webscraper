# Google-Jobs-Webscraper
Google Jobs Webscraper based on job title and lcoation

Go to your file folder where you have all the files in this respository. 

In your path type cmd. 


(your folder path)/cmd

in cmd...

(your folder path)python or python3 spider.py

And it should ask you to input job title and location. Then it will automatically scrape all the details in those jobs including apply links to the jobs, job titles, companies, salary (if there are any), locations, job descriptions ,etc


The average is 169 jobs per scrape. But some have less because of population differences, that then correlate to jobs being offered in that area/expertise. 

Updates coming soon. 


Hope you like it.
